# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Errors include 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading color)' and 'Cannot convert undefined or null to object'. The React app loads but fails to render due to theme context or component initialization issues. WebGL warnings present but not blocking. Fixed some theme context error handling but core issue persists. The application shows a red error screen instead of the expected 3D solar system. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION from main agent to debug and fix these runtime errors before the application can be considered functional."

    message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND ERRORS SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED: Fixed the race condition between React Three Fiber rendering and ThemeContext initialization that was causing 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading color)' errors. Applied comprehensive fixes: 1) Added null safety checks and default fallback values for all theme properties in affected components, 2) Fixed vertexColors buffer attribute issues in CosmicDust and AsteroidBelt components, 3) Ensured all 3D components properly handle theme context initialization. The 3D Solar System Portfolio is now fully functional with all enhanced graphics (animated stars, particle field, cosmic dust, asteroid belt), theme system, mobile responsiveness, and interactive features working correctly. All runtime errors eliminated and the application renders properly."

    message: "COMPLETED UI IMPROVEMENTS: Successfully implemented all requested UI enhancements: 1) Shifted navbar from center to left position for better visual balance, 2) Made information boxes bigger with improved padding and text size for better readability, 3) Made all planets fully opaque by removing transparency settings (opacity: 1.0) for more realistic appearance, 4) Made asteroid belt thinner and smaller by reducing particle count from 600 to 300, decreasing size from 0.8 to 0.5, and narrowing radius range from 22-26 to 23-25 for more realistic proportions. Application compiles successfully and all changes implemented as requested."

    message: "FINAL ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETED: 1) Significantly improved planet textures with 2048x2048 resolution and highly detailed surface features including realistic continents on Earth, enhanced crater systems on Mercury, atmospheric bands and Great Red Spot on Jupiter, polar ice caps and Valles Marineris on Mars, complex cloud systems on Venus, and solar granulation with flares on the Sun. 2) Fixed navbar and system active box heights to match exactly (56px) with proper alignment. 3) Enhanced light mode theme with beautiful gradient background (blue to teal), improved contrast with white cards, and better visual appeal. All improvements successfully applied and application running smoothly."
